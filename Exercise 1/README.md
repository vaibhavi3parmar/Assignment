# Design Patterns in Java

This project demonstrates the implementation of six different design patterns using Java:

1. **Behavioral Patterns**

   - Observer Pattern
   - Strategy Pattern

2. **Creational Patterns**

   - Singleton Pattern
   - Factory Method Pattern

3. **Structural Patterns**
   - Adapter Pattern
   - Decorator Pattern

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files in each directory.
3. Run the demo classes to see the patterns in action.

## Explanation

Each pattern is implemented in a separate folder with a demo class that demonstrates its functionality. Follow the classes and their relationships in the code to understand the patterns better.
